# TAMU_RED 

## Description
This repository contains the work I have done on Texas A&M University Rocket Engine Design. I have programmed microcontrollers, created GUIs for DAQ and control systems, and wrote control laws. These algorithms are tested and used on a 300 lb liquid bi-propellant rocket engine.

## Projects
Elysium - Control system for liquid rocket engine throttling and thrust vectoring\
Genesis - Microcontroller code for a liquid rocket engine DAQ system\
WTS - GUI for a fluid system test bench
